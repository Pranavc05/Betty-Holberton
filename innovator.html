                    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                    <p>
                        Betty Holberton was born Frances Elizabeth Snyder on March 7, 1917, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
                        She studied journalism at the University of Pennsylvania, one of the few fields that allowed women 
                        to write and analyze information at the time. Her curiosity about problem-solving and logical thinking 
                        led her into computing during World War II.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1942, she joined the U.S. Army's project at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of 
                        Electrical Engineering, where she became one of the six original programmers of the ENIAC (Electronic 
                        Numerical Integrator and Computer), the world's first general-purpose electronic digital computer.

                                        Betty Holberton worked in a time when women were systematically excluded from 
                                        professional and academic spaces of computing and engineering. A professor at the 
                                        University of Pennsylvania told her to study something more "appropriate" for a woman.

                                        As part of the all-woman ENIAC programming team, Holberton and her colleagues faced 
                                        gender discrimination and a lack of credit for their pioneering work. They were not 
                                        initially recognized as the world's first computer programmers.

                        <h3>ENIAC Programming</h3>
                        <p>
                            Betty Holberton wrote much of the earliest code for a stored-program computer, working on the 
                            first general-purpose electronic computer with her five female colleagues. They had no manuals or 
                            established methods—they had to invent programming techniques themselves.
                        </p>

                    <div class="contribution-card mb-4">
                        <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
                        <p>
                            Holberton co-developed C-10 for UNIVAC I and contributed to early versions of FORTRAN and COBOL 
                            (Common Business-Oriented Language). COBOL remains in use today in many business applications, 
                            particularly in financial systems.

                        <p>
                            Holberton designed the first format for keyboard input/output, making computing more user-friendly. 
                            She invented features like subroutines, breakpoints, and input/output routines that are still 
                            fundamental to modern programming.

                            After the ENIAC, Holberton worked on designing key components of later computers, including the 
                            UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) and BINAC (Binary Automatic Computer). She also designed 
                            the first keyboard and numeric keypad layout.

                                    Holberton's work laid the foundation for computational thinking, one of the core pillars 
                                    of informatics. She demonstrated how logical, step-by-step problem-solving could be 
                                    transformed into programmable machine operations.

                                    Every time we type on a computer keyboard, run software built on COBOL principles, or 
                                    interact with a logical computing process, we're building upon Holberton's foundational 
                                    thinking and design innovation. Her influence continues to shape the evolving landscape 
                                    of computing and informatics.

                                    Technologies inspired by Holberton's work continue to focus on accessibility, usability, 
                                    and automation. Artificial intelligence and natural language processing rely heavily on 
                                    the kind of logical structure and user interaction principles she pioneered.

                    <h2>Why We Chose Betty Holberton</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our group selected Betty Holberton after reviewing several pioneering figures in computing history, 
                        including Grace Hopper, Ada Lovelace, and Katherine Johnson. While each made important contributions, 
                        we chose Betty Holberton because her story represents the underrepresentation of women in early computing. 
                        She embodied the idea of informatics, connecting human problem-solving with machine logic, and her role 
                        as one of the first programmers makes her a direct ancestor of the modern software engineer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holberton's contributions continue to shape the evolving landscape of computing and informatics. Her 
                        influence on programming languages and interface design foreshadowed today's emphasis on human-centered 
                        computing, bridging design thinking and technology.
